# Hello Manager

I spent a lot of effort and time reading and learning about this little project.
Today I can say that I spent more than 75% of my time on the "Bonus Scenario",
I can say that I did it in some way, if you see the code you will understand what I'm talking about.
Unfortunately, it was very incomprehensible to me.
Like the "NotesForMyJuniorColleague" file,
I also explain here that the other solution the other solution was:
"the ability to create the formulas with different parameters".
so the users can build whatever they need,
If this is what you mean or if you are willing.
I can implement this method, however, it was an interesting experience.
I love your team and company. During the last 3 days,
I canceled my interview with two of the good Iranian companies,
and said that I should become a small member of your team anyway.
love you all. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this text.
