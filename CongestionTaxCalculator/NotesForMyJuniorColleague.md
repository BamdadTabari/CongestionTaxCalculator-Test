# hello friend

0. this is the most important=> there is not any "var" in the Programm, you can see all things Type,
===>>> I called this "transparency" | to get a deep understanding please start with "Program.cs" :)

 
1. I Wrote some tips and comments for you in "DynamicCongestionTaxCalculatorController.cs"
2. now here time is 5:40 AM And Im Working 
3. as you can see I changed whole project, but your codes and notes helped me
4. I refactore your code one time, then I refactore my own code more than 30 time. I dont know why this project is so interesting for me
5. I might fail the test because of a cold. And also maybe because I am ambitious and want to improve my work frequently. Right now, I'm thinking about refactoring a few more parts. And all this took me a lot of time and I made a big thing out of a short test. Last night I was researching and studying for this exam until 7 am. I always took the writing unit test very superficially and usually did not do it. But now I have a contract with him for this project. Now it is the project itself that is important to me and not the test. Meanwhile, I jokingly call you Junior. In general, the concepts of junior and senior are strange to me. In my opinion, in programming, someone who practices and studies with love every day is a senior. How much did I talk, I must do a short refactor due to the pressure of my work, and then I will go to the last giant, which is the bonus scenario.
6. Ok, after 2 days of coding that I spend 60% of it to think and find the best way to implement "Bonus Scenario"
   I just look at the name of program, "CongestionTaxCalculator", and I asked mySelf:
				""""  were am I saving the Calculated Tax :) ?  """"
