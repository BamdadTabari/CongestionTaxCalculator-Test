# Hello

> This is a sample project is written with different coding approaches and handwriting plus unit tests in two different ways. This project was originally a test for recruitment, in which I did not get the necessary points, and according to the HR manager of the company in question, I was second among 38 participants with a slight difference. Maybe. Overdoing it was what led to my failure.
